# Langchain Code README

## How to Run Langchain Code

### Running on VSCode:

Step 1: Activate the virtual environment:
- Click on "View" from the taskbar at the top.
- Select "Terminal" from the drop-down menu.
- Type the following command into the terminal:
   ```
   env/Scripts/Activate.ps1
   ```
- Press Enter.
- You will notice a green `(env)` text appear on the terminal, confirming that your Virtual Environment has been activated.

Step 2: Open the `env` file and enter your personal API keys:
- Open the `[DOT]env` file.
- Enter your personal OPENAI_API_KEY, PINECONE_ENV, and PINECONE_API_KEY.

Step 3: Running on VSCode:
- Since this is a `[DOT]IPYNB` file, you can directly start running it cell by cell.
- Depending on the laptop dependencies, feel free to use PIP on the activated terminal to install any additional packages based on the system you are using.

### Running on Jupyter Notebook:

You don't need to activate the virtual environment while using Jupyter Notebook. Just ensure that you have the `[DOT]env` file in the same folder as your code in both scenarios.
